# Flight Fare Prediction

An end to end machine learning application used to determine the price of flight tickets.

The project uses data processing techniques such as EDA, Data Cleaning, Handling Null Values and Data Vizualization.

Then the data is used to train different models such as DecisionTree Regressor, XGBoosting, SVR. These models are then stacked to make the result more accurate.

The final file is exported as a Pickle file. This Pickle file is then routed using FlaskAPI and ReactJS to create an interface for the application. 

It takes the following inputs from the user:
1. Date of Departure 
2. Source of Flight
3. Destination of Flight 
4. Number of Stops 
5. Class of Travel (Economy, Business, First-Class)
